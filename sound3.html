        <b>Interaction 3: Tilt Side to Side → Brass</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Gesture:</b> The phone is placed flat and tilted from side to side
        <br />
        <b>Sound:</b> Brass instrument (synthesized using Faust)
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Design Motivation:</b>
        <br />
        This mapping connects the side-to-side tilting motion of the device with the breath pressure control of a brass instrument. As you tilt the device left or right, the rotation angle (rotationX/Roll) is mapped to the pressure parameter of the brass sound synthesis, creating a continuous and expressive control mechanism. The more you tilt, the higher the pressure, which affects the intensity and character of the brass sound.
        <br />
        <br />
        This interaction design is motivated by the physical analogy between breath control in brass instruments and the tilting gesture. Just as a brass player controls the sound by varying breath pressure, the user controls the sound by varying the tilt angle of the device. The use case scenario could be a virtual brass instrument app, a music education tool, or an expressive musical interface where users can perform brass sounds through intuitive physical gestures.
