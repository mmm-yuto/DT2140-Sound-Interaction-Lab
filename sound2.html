        <b>Interaction 2: Point Straight Up → Bells</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Gesture:</b> The phone is used to point straight up
        <br />
        <b>Sound:</b> Bells (synthesized using Faust)
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Design Motivation:</b>
        <br />
        This mapping connects the gesture of pointing the device straight up with the sound of bells. The action of raising the device upward mimics the physical motion of pulling a bell rope upward, creating a natural and intuitive connection between gesture and sound. When the device's pitch angle (rotationY) reaches approximately 90 degrees (pointing straight up), the bell sound is triggered.
        <br />
        <br />
        This interaction design is motivated by the cultural and physical association between upward movements and bell ringing. In many cultures, bells are rung by pulling a rope upward, and this gesture mapping recreates that physical relationship in a digital context. The use case scenario could be a meditation app, a church bell simulator, or an interactive musical instrument where users can "ring" bells by pointing their device skyward.
