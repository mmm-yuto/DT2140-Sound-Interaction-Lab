        <b>Interaction 1: Shake (Horizontal) → Engine</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Gesture:</b> iPhoneを横向きに持って振る (The phone is held horizontally and shaken)
        <br />
        <b>Sound:</b> Engine (synthesized using Faust)
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Design Motivation:</b>
        <br />
        This mapping connects the action of shaking the phone while held horizontally with the sound of an engine. The intensity of the shaking motion directly controls the volume and speed of the engine sound - the more vigorously you shake the device, the louder and faster the engine becomes. This creates an intuitive mapping where the physical effort of shaking corresponds to the engine's RPM (revolutions per minute).
        <br />
        <br />
        This interaction design is motivated by the natural analogy between physical motion and engine performance. Just as an engine's speed increases with more throttle, shaking the device more vigorously increases the engine sound's intensity. The use case scenario could be a racing game, a vehicle simulator, or an interactive sound installation where users can control engine sounds through physical gesture. The horizontal orientation ensures that the gesture feels natural and ergonomic, similar to holding a steering wheel or throttle control.
